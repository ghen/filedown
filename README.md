# File Downloader

**FileDownloader** is a simple HTTP REST SPI service built with .NET Core 3.x, that allows clients to schedule and track multiple files download jobs.

## Requirements

* **Windows 7 (64 bit)** or higher
* **.NET Core 3.1 Runtime** or later

## Clone

## Build

## Test

## Run

For local testing (and production troubleshooting) application can be run in **console mode**. In this mode application will run from current working directory (affects relative paths resolution if used in configuration), and will terminate immediately upon current console session completion.

* To run application in **console mode** use ***--console*** command line switch:

  ```
  > filedown --console
  ```

* To exit application use ***Ctrl+C*** control sequence, or terminate current console session.

**Note:**
> During development application can be run from **Microsoft Visual Studio** IDE directly. It will execute in **console mode** by default.

## Service Installation

Application can be installed as a local service using scripts provided in **./scripts**. No special tools are needed (other than **.NET Core 3.1 Runtime** being installed). User would also require elevated rights in order to install or uninstall service under the **Windows** operating system.

## Configuration

Application can be configured in all supported **.NET Core 3.1** manners. The easiest way would be to alter **./webhost.json** and **./services.json** files:

[services.json]

```json
{
  "FileDownload" : {
    "jobs": 3,
    "threads": 3,
    "downloads": "./downloads"
  }
}
```

[webhost.json]

```json
{
  "urls": "http://localhost:8080/api"
}
```

Supported settings:

| Path			     | Required | Type        | Description |
| -------------- |:--------:|:-----------:| ----------- |
| **urls**	     | Req      | String(1024) | HTTP REST API path to listen for incoming WEB requests for. |
| **jobs**	     | Req      | Number      | Number of maximum allowed parallel jobs. |
| **threads**    | Req      | Number      | Default number of threads per job. |
| **downloads**  | Req      | String(1024) | Path to the local folder to store downloaded files. |

## Logs

**Note:**
> Default log files location is **./logs**.

Structured logs are sent to console (in console mode only), as well as saved to local file system as instructed in **./nlog.config** file. Application should also be configured to have sufficient privileges to access logs files location.

Sample console output is shown bellow:

## REST API

HTTP REST API provided to all supporting clients.

### JSON vs XML

All data can be sent/received either in JSON or XML format.

Request format is defined by  **Content-Type** HTTP header, and response format is defined by **Accept** HTTP header correspondingly ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields)). For example:

    [Request]
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json

If desired format is not provided, **application/json** is used by default.
